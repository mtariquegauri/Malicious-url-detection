# Malicious-url-detection

•	This project was aimed at implementing a web based Machine Learning model to classify the type of URL.
•	Logistic Regression (Binary classification) is used and dataset is taken from Kaggle.
•The dataset is tokenize and unnecessary keywords are removed.
•Vectorize the Data -  the vectorizers will turn our features into numbers

Steps : 
->After implementing the model we have created the pickle file.
->A separate flask file is created which is linked to html and css files.
->Pickle file is imported in the flask file.
->After successfully linking all files, we get the interface on the local host where we are required to enter the URL. Model will predict whether the entered url is good or bad.
